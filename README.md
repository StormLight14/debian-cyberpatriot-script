# debian-cyberpatriot-script
Basic script to get some points right off the bat for Debian/Ubuntu images.

**Unfinished and not fully tested**

## Using
If the README file on the image has a list of authorized users, clear the `authorized-users.txt` file and put one user per line.

If the script asks for a "main user", that just is whatever one the image has you logged in as.

ALSO to other teams who see this: don't be lazy and make your own script smh
