# debian-cyberpatriot-script
Basic script to get some points right off the bat for Debian/Ubuntu images.

**Unfinished and not fully tested**

## Using
If the README file on the image has a list of authorized users, fill out the `authorized-users.txt` file and make sure it isn't set to `DISABLED`.

If the script asks for a "main user", that just is whatever one the image has you logged in as.

## Todo
- [ ] Colored Text (Errors, Warnings)
- [ ] Some other things probably
